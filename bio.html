		 <h4>ACT I - CHILDHOOD</h4>
		 
         <p id="firstp">   
            I was born in New Haven, CT while my father was finishing a Master's Degree at Yale University.
			Shortly thereafter, my Dad began a long, distinguished actuarial career at Aetna Life and Casualty; 
			hence, I grew up in the suburbs of Hartford.  I am the oldest of three and the only son in a 
			"traditional" family.
         </p>

 		 <h4>ACT II - MY YALE YEARS</h4>
		 
         <p>
			After 13 years of public schools, persistent parents and some native ability, I was accepted to 
			Yale University. Yale was a glorious experience for me - after years of being the egghead, I was 
			finally in an environment where I fit in.
         </p>
         <p>
			In hindsight, I realize I did not make the best use 
			of my time in New Haven, but youth has not the wisdom in the moment.
         </p>

		 <h4>ACT III - THE ACTUARIAL EXPERIENCE</h4>
		 
         <p>
			After college, I continued to follow in my father's foot steps, working in the insurance industry 
			and studying to be an actuary.  Unlike my dad, I only finished the exams through the associate level.
			Over the course of 27-years, I worked for two life insurance companies and two life reinsurance 
			companies in three different states: Connecticut, Florida, Missouri and then back to Florida.  One 
			theme, not intentional, in my past employers has been a steady progression to a smaller size employer.
		 </p>
		 <p>
			While working for RGA in Missouri, I also had the opportunity to work and live in Hong Kong, where 
			I met my wife.
         </p>

		 <h4>ACT IV - THE NEXT ACT</h4>

         <p>
			This brings us to the present.  I have a much greater appreciation of who I am, what my strengths 
			and weaknesses are.  I think I have finally grown up enough to set out in my own direction.
			I have enrolled at Valencia College to study computer programming.  The computer industry is such a 
			broad and complex field, I am still not sure exactly where I fit in.  However, I am excited and 
			looking forward to the future. 
		 </p>
		 <p>
			Just a few more steps before I take flight in my new career:
		 </p>
		 <div>
			<ul>
				<li>More, and continuing, education as this industry evolves at breakneck speed.</li>
				<li>Finding internship opportunites to develop my skills and establish myself.</li>
				<li>Deciding to work for a small highly effective employer or starting my own company.
					The logo in the upper left corner on the home page for this site is actually the current 
					design for my company which is in an inactive state at present.
				</li>
			</ul>
